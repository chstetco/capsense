# CapSense: A Real-Time Capacitive Sensor Simulation Framework for Physical Human-Robot Interaction

**CapSense** is a real-time capacitive sensor simulation framework aimed to be used in robotic applications for future applications in sim-to-real transfer learning using proximity sensing modalities.

The framework allows simulation of capacitive proximity sensors with different configuration parameters in different scenarios embedded in robot simulators such as *(i)* CoppeliaSim, *(ii)* Unity3D and *(iii*) PyBullet.

## More detailed documentation coming soon!

## Main features

* Generation of capacitive proximity sensor **raw data** in real-time
* Fully customizable capacitive sensor topologies based on STL files

A paper describing CapSense has been submitted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) with IROS2022 presentation option. 
A video showcasing the frameworks capabilities in different scenarios can be found on our Youtube channel.

**NOTE:** We are continuosly working to improve and expand the CapSense framework.
